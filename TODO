- fix tape measure on rotated images

- get some tiles flashing during rotate animation

- set textures to clip rather than wrap

- double-click on annotation, only "delete" works, cancel and ok seem 
  to do nothing?

- doubleclick in nav tool trickes down into viewer and causes a zoom

- screen2layer / layer2screen could be much faster

- add culling: we currently draw all layers from the back, we could skip 
  tiles we know muct be complete obscured by higher-res tiles

  would fix 10x overdraw in some cases
