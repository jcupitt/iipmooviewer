- touch interface ... touch.js directly changes the CSS transforms with a
  different code path, yuk!!

- edit annotation window is rotated if image is rotated

  annotation tips are not rotated, how is this done?

  annotation tip is a child of viewer (a peer of scale etc) and so is not
  affected by the rotate transform

  it's positioned absolutely, how is the position calculated?

  from the stored annotation position, but how does it map from the canvas
  position to the absolute screen position?

- test sync mode

- test blend mode, might not be possible

- need to recentre on fullscreen / notfullscreen

  can't fix this without changing iipmooviewer ... we need to sort out the
  canvas positioning and scrolling code

- drag on rotated image does not work

  can't fix this without changing iipmooviewer ... we need to sort out the

- screen2layer / layer2screen could be much faster

- add culling: we currently draw all layers from the back, we could skip 
  tiles we know muct be complete obscured by higher-res tiles

  would fix 10x overdraw in some cases
