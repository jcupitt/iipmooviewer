- arghview rewrite

  reached setPosition



- drag while rotated is not working

	we need to sort out what the coordinates given to setPosition mean,
	and how they are affected by rotation

	this will feed into smooth scaling too: generally, how do we
	transform to image space from screen space

- doubleclick in nav tool trickes down into viewer and causes a zoom

- screen2image / image2screen could be much faster
