- double-click on annotation, only "delete" works, cancel and ok seem 
  to do nothing?

  not a problem in annotations-edit.js, putting the master version back 
  does not fix it ... something about event handing in iipmooviewer?

- need to recentre on resize

- doubleclick in nav tool trickes down into viewer and causes a zoom

- screen2layer / layer2screen could be much faster

- add culling: we currently draw all layers from the back, we could skip 
  tiles we know muct be complete obscured by higher-res tiles

  would fix 10x overdraw in some cases
