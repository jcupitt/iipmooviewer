- edit annotation window is rotated if image is rotated

  annotation tips are not rotated, how is this done?

- test sync mode

- test blend mode, might not be possible

- need to recentre on fullscreen / notfullscreen

  can't fix this without changing iipmooviewer ... we need to sort out the
  canvas positioning and scrolling code

- drag on rotated image does not work

- screen2layer / layer2screen could be much faster

- add culling: we currently draw all layers from the back, we could skip 
  tiles we know muct be complete obscured by higher-res tiles

  would fix 10x overdraw in some cases
