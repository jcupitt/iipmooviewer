- double-click on annotation, only "delete" works, cancel and ok seem 
  to do nothing?

  not a problem in annotations-edit.js, putting the master version back 
  does not fix it ... something about event handing in iipmooviewer?

- need to recentre on fullscreen / notfullscreen

  can't fix this without changing iipmooviewer ... we need to sort out the
  canvas positioning and scrolling code

- drag on rotated image does not work

- screen2layer / layer2screen could be much faster

- add culling: we currently draw all layers from the back, we could skip 
  tiles we know muct be complete obscured by higher-res tiles

  would fix 10x overdraw in some cases
